# MLPractice

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of machine learning practice notebooks, datasets, and resources. It is organized to help users learn, experiment, and apply various machine learning algorithms and techniques using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Structure

- **Notebooks**: Core machine learning topics are covered in individual Jupyter notebooks, including regression, classification, clustering, neural networks, and more.
- **Chapters/**: Contains chapter-wise notebooks for structured learning.
- **Classifications/**: Notebooks for different classification algorithms (KNN, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, etc.).
- **Clustering/**: Notebooks for clustering techniques (K-Means, EM, Density Estimation, K-Modes, etc.).
- **CNNPractice/**: Practice notebooks for Convolutional Neural Networks, including data for MNIST.
- **Datasets/**: A variety of datasets in CSV, TXT, XLS, and other formats for hands-on practice.
- **RealWorldPractice/**: Notebooks applying ML techniques to real-world datasets (e.g., Dermatology, Hatecrime Analysis).
- **YouTube-Spam-Collection-v1/**: Datasets for spam detection practice.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sayedli/MLPractice.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   - Recommended: Use a Python virtual environment.
   - Install required packages (e.g., numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow, etc.)
   - Example:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - If no `requirements.txt` is present, install packages as needed per notebook.
3. **Open notebooks**:
   - Use Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code to open and run `.ipynb` files.

## Datasets

All datasets used in the notebooks are included in the `Datasets/` folder and subfolders. These cover a wide range of domains for regression, classification, clustering, and more.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to add new notebooks, datasets, or improve existing ones. Please submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
